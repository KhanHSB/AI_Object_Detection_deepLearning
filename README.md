:: Please feel free to utilize the code for your projects with proper citations under the fair use and citation agreement.
:: This project is for demonstration purposes, if you'd like to use it commercially, I've built a much more refined and advanced version that is avaliable for download. Please email me directly at haseebk73@gmail.com.

Some Basic Instructions: 

1. You will need to download the Yolo.h5 file, place it in the models_data directory, and the yolo.weights file and place it in the yolo_data directory. The weights file exceeds github's space requirements, the weights are therefore not included with this package.

2. Please make sure you have all the dependencies installed for the module.
